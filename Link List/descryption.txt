indexes.stream(): This part converts the list of indexes (indexes) into a stream of elements. A stream is a sequence of elements that you can process sequentially.

.map(String::valueOf): This part is a mapping operation. It takes each element from the stream (which are integers in this case) and converts them to strings. String::valueOf is a method reference to the valueOf method of the String class, which is used to convert other data types into strings. So, it converts each index (an integer) into a string representation of that index.

.collect(Collectors.joining(", ")): This part is where we collect the elements from the stream into a single string. We use the Collectors.joining(", ") collector to join the elements with a comma and a space in between. So, it effectively creates a string by joining all the strings (indexes) with commas and spaces.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

Suppose you have a list of indexes indexes containing [2, 5, 8]. When you apply the operations I described, you get:

indexes.stream() converts the list to a stream: Stream(2, 5, 8)
.map(String::valueOf) converts the integers to strings: Stream("2", "5", "8")
.collect(Collectors.joining(", ")) joins the strings: "2, 5, 8"
So, this entire expression transforms a list of indexes into a single string where the indexes are separated by commas and spaces.
